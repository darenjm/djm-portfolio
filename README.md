# DJM Portfolio - Responsive 

This is the first project of the Udacity Grow with Google FEND

# Description 

I used 3 break points to get the layout I wanted at these screen widths

> 768
> 850
> 980

980 was used to set the container width. Over all I was focused on getting a feel for building with HTML and CSS. As I moved along I started to to try and use global seeting as much as possible so I wasn't wrtting the same code multiple times. For example, I set styles for all the <h1> thru <h4> in one block as well as the <p> tags and anchor tags.

### Built with

I used Atom for the first time so I was getting to know the work flow as I went along. I made the swithch from Brackets becasue I like to be able to see mulitple tags and and have windows open form previous projects to refer back to the code I did earlier. 

### Github

Having a hard time with Github so far. Haven;t put in the necessary time to learn it. I've used it before but fumbled through. Good experience and looking forward to gettign the hang of it.
